Enter a link to any mathematician on https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=7401 to find the shortest path on the website to Euler assuming that he is in and above the entered mathematician on their "mathematical family tree"! 

Further improvements:
- Actually catch the case where Euler is not present in the entered mathematician's tree
- Improve speed by using the date where each advisor got their dissertation
- Change the algorithm to allow it to search children in addition to parents.
